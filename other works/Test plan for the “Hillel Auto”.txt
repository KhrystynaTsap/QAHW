Risks and contingencies
* Delayed correction of defects by the development team. May cause delays in product release.
To resolve, hold weekly meetings with developers to discuss time requirements for eliminating defects. Discussions on changing the deadline view are possible
* Inaccurately described product requirements. May lead to the development of a product not in demand by users.
To avoid the creation of a product that does not meet the expectations of users, the requirements for the program must be agreed with the teams of developers, testers, and stakeholders
* Structural changes in the team (layoffs, maternity leave, sick leave) may lead to non-compliance with the deadline.
In case of a reduction in the working staff on the project, the responsibilities of the employee who dropped out of the process are distributed among the team. Possible discussions of changing the deadline with the product owner.
