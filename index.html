<h2>Hi all!</h2>
<div>
<p>I'm Khrystyna Tsap, 22 years old. I live in Lviv.</p>
<p>I graduated from <abbr title="Institute of Business and Perspective Technologies">IBPT</abbr> as a Junior specialist with honors and with a bachelor's in absentia in Marketing.</p>
<p>Â I've been working at Kyivstar for 5 years; for now, my profession is service manager in the Client Support department.</p>
<p>I'm going to change jobs and become a QA specialist. Because of this, I've been studying the QA Manual course since April 27th. I've already learned such things as:
<ul>
<li>Testing theory</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of SDLC and STLC</li>
<li>Creating and maintaining test documentation (test cases, checklists, test plans etc.)</li>
<li>Bug reporting, retesting, and closing (in the Jira bug track system)</li>
<li>Testing APIs in POSTMAN (REST and GraphQL)</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of network architecture</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of HTML</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Except for work, I also have hobbies. I like to read manga and practice digital art (pixel art and raster graphics).</p>
<p>My aim is to create a game in the near future with my boyfriend as a game artist (coding will be my partner's job). Now that I've already created some assets for this project: <a href="pages/Gallery.html" target="_blank">Assets</a></p>
